title: Solving the mistery of the KL divergence
categories: jupyter python machine-learning pytorch programming

All of the posts under the "jupyter" category were Jupyter notebooks I converted to Markdown using Pandoc.

In this notebook, I try to understand how the KL divergence works, specifically the one from PyTorch.

Relevant docs are here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.KLDivLoss

Basically, given an $N \times \ast $ tensor `x`, where $\ast$ represents any number of dimensions besides the first one, the first dimension of `x` will hold $N$ tensors. Each one of these tensors symbolizes a (discrete) probability distribution. This means that each of the tensors must sum to 1 (`x.sum(0) = [1.0 ,1.0 ,1.0 ,...]`).

An easy way to do that to the output of a neural network is to use the softmax function. Another is to divide each value inside the tensor by the sum of all values.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
```

In this function, I calculate the KL divergence betwwen `a1` and `a2` both by hand as well as by using PyTorch's `kl_div()` function. My goals were to get the same results from both and to understand the different behaviors of the function depending on the value of the `reduction` parameter.

First, both tensors must have the same dimensions and every single tensor after dimension 0 must sum to 1, _i.e._ dimension 0 is the batch dimension and each individual tensor in this dimension represents a (discrete) probability distribution. Applying `x.softmax(0)` accomplishes this.

Furthermore, we need to apply the log to the values in the
first collection. `log_softmax(0)` accomplishes both at the same time.


```python
def kl_div(a1, a2):
    # the individual terms of the KL divergence can be calculated like this
    manual_kl = (a2.softmax(0) * (a2.log_softmax(0) - a1.log_softmax(0)))

    # applying necessary transformations
    a1ready = a1.log_softmax(0)
    a2ready = a2.softmax(0)

    print('\nSums')
    print(manual_kl.sum())
    print(F.kl_div(a1ready, a2ready, reduction='none').sum())
    print(F.kl_div(a1ready, a2ready, reduction='sum'))

    print('\nMeans')
    print(manual_kl.mean())
    print(F.kl_div(a1ready, a2ready, reduction='none').mean())
    print(F.kl_div(a1ready, a2ready, reduction='mean'))

    print('\nBatchmean')
    print(manual_kl.mean(0).sum())
    print(F.kl_div(a1ready, a2ready, reduction='batchmean'))
```

Here I apply the above function on 2D tensors.


```python
torch.manual_seed(1)
dist = torch.distributions.uniform.Uniform(0,10)
a1 = dist.sample((5 ,2))
a2 = dist.sample((5, 2))

print((a1/a1.sum()).sum())

kl_div(a1, a2)
```

Here I apply the above function on 3D tensors.


```python

dist = torch.distributions.uniform.Uniform(0,10)
a1 = dist.sample((10, 6, 4))
a2 = dist.sample((10, 6, 4))
a1s = a1.softmax(2)
a2s = a2.softmax(2)
