I was fortunate to have published a paper in the [Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems](https://www.springer.com/journal/10846). While its [preprint on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13684) will remain there, I am allowed to host the post-review, pre-published version, which was greatly expanded, on my personal website.

For those of you who have found this page, [here is the link]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/jint2021-aam.pdf) to download the paper.
