I was fortunate to have [published a paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-021-01336-y) in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems. While its [preprint on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13684) will remain there, I am allowed to host the post-review, pre-published version, which was greatly expanded, on my personal website . ou can find it below.
