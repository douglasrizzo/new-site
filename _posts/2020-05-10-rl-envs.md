[OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/): I also recommend you take a look at the [list of third-party environments](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/docs/environments.md#third-party-environments). There is even a [neat gridworld](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid).

[OpenAI Retro](https://github.com/openai/retro): if you remember OpenAI Universe, which promised that you could train DRL algorithms on games like GTA V, this is what you get. They used libretro to create environments of retro console games.

[PySC2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2)

[StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac)

[Half-Field Offense (HFO)](https://github.com/LARG/HFO): this one is the favorite for people who want to do RL on something that resembles the F-180/small size soccer robot teams from RoboCup. I've seen it in quite a few publications but, unfortunately, couldn't get it to work back in 2019. The last true update of the repository was in 2017 and it looks like people who want to use it nowadays have to do a lot of work in order to get it to run.

[ELF](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ELF): this was one of my first experiences with other people's code. The was a paper about this environment [published on NIPS](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6859-elf-an-extensive-lightweight-and-flexible-research-platform-for-real-time-strategy-games), the [README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ELF) on GitHub was really pretty to look at and there were two Facebook AI/Research pages [\[1\]](https://research.fb.com/downloads/elf/) [\[2\]](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/elf) advertising the project as serious business. After I got it to run, only one of the three games advertised actually worked out-of-the-box and could only be started through a single Python script that used lots of dictionaries with keyword arguments to configure everything, without any documentation. There was no room for any customization. Very different from the Gym environments AI researchers are used to work with, none of which have that much advertisement behind them. Needless to say I started looking at AI research from top tier groups in a whole different way.
