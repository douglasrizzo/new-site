Hello internet. I'm a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence. I'm also a computer programmer/software developer.

My PhD research started with an interest in teaching AI agents how to play electronic games, both new and old. I've since refined it by trying to achieve multi-agent reinforcement learning with heterogeneous agents using neural networks. I am particularly interested in the applications in real-time strategy games, such as StarCraft 2.

In my research career, I've also worked with robots and computerized adaptive tests. In my professional career, I've worked with back-end web development and database and server maintenance.
